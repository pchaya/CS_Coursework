	<h3><br>Assignment 1: <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~chayap/">Introduction</a></h3>
	The purpose of this assignment was to create an introductory website using only HTML for the CS 290 course. One challenge that I faced in this process was transferring my files to the public student webspace. I originally worked on my webpage through the Z: drive, which created an inaccessible website. 
	<p>Prior to doing this assignment, I had used HTML and CSS to create a personal website and had a high level understanding of how HTML works. However, this assignment allowed me to refresh my knowledge and understand how the browser interprets HTML on a lower level, along with DOM. I also had not used Git Bash prior to this assignment, so I was able to learn how to push/pull from GitHub through the Git Bash.
	<p>In order to solve the issue of working in the Y: drive, I used the resources in the Oregon State IT help on public webspaces to fix this issue (<a href="https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/where-do-i-put-my-personal-webpages"> Where do I put my personal webpages?"</a>), and Piazza. I also used the class Discord study group to find a suitable text editor for this course, as prior to taking this course I was using only Vim, and I wanted to try an IDE or a text editor suited for Web Development.
