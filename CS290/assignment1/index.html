	<p><h3>This is my introduction website for CS 290! Here is a little information about me:</h3></p>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is Prathyoosha Chaya, and I also go by 'PC'.
		<li>Email: <a href="mailto:chayap@oregonstate.edu">chayap@oregonstate.edu</a>
		<li>I am a freshman studying Computer Science. I am new to OSU, so I am excited to explore the CS department here. I took Data Structures and Programming Systems in PSU this past year.
		<li>I would rate myself as a 2 or 3; I have written in HTML and CSS for fun before, but aside from that I am completely new to web development.
		<li>I hope to get an understanding of full-stack web development, as it is something that I do not know much about.
		<li>Yes, I have signed up for Piazza.
		<li>I was extremely involved in <abbr title="For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology">FIRST</abbr> Robotics for around 10 years, which led me to the field of Computer Science. Also, I can write in Gallifreyan! :)
